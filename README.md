# Micro-Frontend-Example
A demonstration of a micro frontend architecture where components are built using different frontend frameworks - React, Angular, and Vue.js. This repository showcases how multiple frontend frameworks can be integrated into a single application, allowing developers to leverage the strengths of each framework within a unified project structure.


# Micro Frontend Example

This project demonstrates a micro frontend architecture where components are built using different frontend frameworks - React, Angular, and Vue.js.

## Overview

Micro frontend is an architectural style where independently deliverable frontend applications are composed into a greater whole. In this project, we have separate components built with React, Angular, and Vue.js, all integrated into a single application.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Angular CLI (for Angular component)
- Vue CLI (for Vue.js component)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/bamaniyamilan/Micro-Frontend-Example)
   cd micro-frontend-example

npm install
cd ../react-component
npm install
cd ../vue-component
npm install


Running the Application
Build each component:

bash
Copy code
# Angular component
cd angular-component
ng build --prod

# React component
cd ../react-component
npm run build

# Vue.js component
cd ../vue-component
npm run build

Start the application:


Copy code
# From the root directory
npm start


Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to see the application running.


#Usage
Once the application is running, you will see the integrated components from React, Angular, and Vue.js on the same page. Each component demonstrates a simple "Hello World" message.
